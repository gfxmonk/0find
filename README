0find is a simple program that uses zeroinstall's python API to
get the local path implementing a given interface. This is useful
for passing into scripts that are not themselves managed via 0install.

sample usage:

	0launch http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/0find.xml http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/file-finder.xml

will (on my machine) print:

	/home/tim/.cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1new=73323f6793e85192518dc4eaa39ad32b4377f78a

You now have a concrete path you can pass into utilities that require
a path, rather than a 0install interface.

You can also use the zerofind python interface directly, if you prefer:

	>>> import zerofind
	>>> zerofind.find('http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/file-finder.xml')
	u'/home/tim/.cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1new=73323f6793e85192518dc4eaa39ad32b4377f78a'
